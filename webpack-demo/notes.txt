Loaders allow Webpack to process and bundle these non-JavaScript files by transforming them into modules that can be included in the dependency graph and ultimately bundled.

{
  test: /\.css$/,
  use: ['css-loader', 'style-loader']
}

css-loader -> Transforming CSS code into JavaScript modules that Webpack can process
style-loader -> Injecting CSS styles into the DOM at runtime when the JavaScript bundle is executed in the browser.
